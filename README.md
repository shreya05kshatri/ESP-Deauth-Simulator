# ESP-Deauth-Simulator
A web-based educational simulator for Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks using ESP8266. Includes user interaction and data collection via a local access point.

# üö® ESP-Deauth-Simulator

This is an  simulation of a Wi-Fi deauthentication attack using an ESP8266 microcontroller. It sets up a local access point with a web interface where users can simulate a deauth trigger and send custom data to the ESP8266 for processing and future logging.
